# Kernel
College project
First, create a .asm file i.e Kernel.asm
Second, create a .c file i.e. kernel.c
We will assemble kernel.asm with NASM to an object file; and then using GCC we will compile kernel.c to another object file. Now, our job is to get these objects linked to an executable bootable kernel. Using link.ld file.
